# dotatom: My sourced  -/.atom files

This repo contains the configuration and package files of my Atom text editor application. I keep it sourced here in case my computer dies or I need to switch to another machine.

One issue with starting from scratch with these files is that you need to go into each package and run `npm install`, maybe so files get sym-linked properly. Not sure why, but I had to do it when I set up a friend on Atom with my settings.

I figured it might also be mildly interesting for others who happen to stumble upon this to see what I'm running. So, enjoy!

# Markdown grammar

A realistic implementation of various Markdown specifications as a flexible, drop-in alternative for [language-gfm](https://github.com/atom/language-gfm/). Adds smart context-aware behavior to lists.

**An effort for better syntax-theme support/integration is underway (see #83 for details). Until markup styles are (somewhat) standardized, there is a good chance that not everything in your Markdown documents is correctly hightlighted. If you run into any issues, please report them [here](issues/new/) or at their respective repos and link me (@burodepeper) in the description.**

If you experience any issue above a reasonable/tolerable level of annoyancy, don't hesitate to [create an issue](issues/new/).

## Supported grammar

- CommonMark Markdown
- Github Flavored Markdown (including AtomDoc)
- Markdown Extra
- CriticMark annotation
- Front Matter (yaml and toml)
- R Markdown

### Additional features

- **Smarter lists**
  - Automatically create new list-items when pressing <kbd>enter</kbd>
  - Indent or outdent list-items by pressing <kbd>tab</kbd> or <kbd>shift+tab</kbd>
  - Toggle tasks with <kbd>cmd+shift+x</kbd> or <kbd>ctrl+shift+x</kbd>
  - Remove empty list-items when pressing <kbd>enter</kbd>

### Syntax-theme support

By default, most syntax-themes only provide basic styling for `.markup` classes. This package provides additional, more specific classes which are supported by the following syntax-themes:

**Full/extended support**

- [minimal-syntax](https://atom.io/themes/minimal-syntax) (light, high-contrast)
- [minimal-syntax-dark](https://atom.io/themes/minimal-syntax-dark) (dark, high-contrast)
- [pen-paper-coffee](https://atom.io/themes/pen-paper-coffee-syntax) (light, low-contrast)
- [pubster-syntax](https://atom.io/themes/pubster-syntax) (dark, high-contrast)

## Installation instructions

1. Install `language-markdown` via
  - your console: `apm install language-markdown`
  - the Atom GUI: `Atom` > `Settings` > `Install` > Search for `language-markdown`
2. Restart Atom (as a pre-caution; shouldn't be necessary)

## Contributing

First of all, any and all contributions are more than welcome! Having said that, things over here are a little different than in other Atom packages.

1. The main grammar file (`language-markdown.json`) is compiled, so there is no use in changing it directly. Instead, the grammar has been split up into several smaller pieces which can be found in `/grammars/repositories`, and the grammar for fenced-code-blocks is compiled from a list that can be found in `/grammars/fixtures`. After you have changed anything, you can recompile the main grammar by executing the `compile-grammar-and-reload` command (<kbd>cmd+alt+ctrl+c</kbd> on Mac OS X, and <kbd>shift-alt-ctrl-c</kbd> on other platforms) which is only available while in `dev-mode`. This will also automatically reload Atom for you.
2. Specs are written in a custom format called `ASS` and can be found in `/spec/fixtures` as `.ass` files. I believe they are pretty self-explanatory, and installing [language-ass](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-ass/) will add syntax highlighting for you. In combination with [minimal-syntax](https://atom.io/packages/minimal-syntax) this makes them a breeze to work with. Pun intended.
3. When submitting a PR, please do so on the `dev` branch, instead of directly on `master`. It's not that big of a deal, but it keeps merge conflicts going back and forth between `master` and `dev` to a minimum.
4. When in doubt about a conflict on the main grammar file, don't worry about it. Before publishing an update, it will be re-compiled anyway.

### Add extended support for language-markdown to your syntax-theme

As part of PR #83, all scopes created by this grammar are being rewritten and re-evaluated. An aspect of all of this is the creation of a set of generic markup-related styles that can be used across different languages. I've created a `.less` [template](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/blob/dev-scopes/resources/markup-and-down.less) (this version is not final!) to easily implement these generic styles in your syntax-theme.

#### Notes

- Raw `html` is included when you have the default `language-html` grammar enabled
- The Github Flavored `task-lists` are implemented as part of 'normal' `lists`
- Setext-headers (underlined-headers) are not supported
- `indented-code-blocks` have been disabled to prevent false-positives; use `fenced-code-blocks` instead ([more details](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/88#issuecomment-183344420))
- Github tables require pipes at the start of each line, and cells need a padding of at least one space; this is a suggested convention to prevent false positives
